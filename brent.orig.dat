House hunting is the equivalent of someone kicking you in the groin repeatedly for days/weeks on end.
Man, it's a shitshow
It's soul crushing
Toronto: aka the only city where you can find a 1500+ sq ft home and not have to prostitute yourself as a side gig
Canada post is the fucking worst: pay $30 for an "overnight delivery", 4 days later it's "out for delivery".
Canada Post said they'd be there on Friday. Nope.
"Canada Post hasn't mastered..." could be a long list of items
I'm proposing we build a wall to keep American policies out of Canada.
I am disappointed that whereisdustin.com is no longer a thing. @drej's slipping.
Porsche SUV - I'm going to assume the driver was an ass
Is Don Cheadle the new Ja?
I'll be there in spirit
FUCK. THAT. NOISE.
Virtual Brent? I'd be willing to yell into a microphone for a few hours to make it happen. Hell, if you can get it to write some code just mail me my paychecks and we're done here
*whacks over head with newspaper*
I'd watch Don Draper bust out buzzwords for an hour and a half
I don't fuck with anything less than 4 stars
I'm flying on zero fucks. Vacation mode engaged
I love how we always have to bring @drej up to speed. We're his personal assistant
Rounded corners are so hot right now
Capitalism rules
The forecast for the next few days is looking awesome. I'm so glad I live somewhere where -30+ is a thing
hahaha, love the hat. Screams I&apos;m super old but hip!
I feel like my knowledge of French has eclipsed my knowledge of whatever the hell people are talking about these days. And my French is fairly shitty
Catapults are lame. Trebuchets are where its at
just remember nose plugs. The BO gets really bad this time of year
Neckbeards in makeshift chainmail baking in the sun.  Bad combo

Memes are the only thing keeping Kristen from eviction
I hear a rumor your memes are made in a Bangladeshi sweat shop for 10 cents/hour
Do any of us look like we have a vested interest in bodybuilding?
Sad day
Costco sized bags of raisins for all
I would also like to express that figs are also not treats. Fig Newtons are like those gross orange wrapped halloween candies of snack foods. Something invented by some sadistic asshold. The person who brings fig newtons to your cottage/road trip/weekend getaway is not your friend and you should immediately cut them out from your life.
This was weird. Like some kind of weird Turkish wisdom :stuck_out_tongue:
404 Ice Cream Not Found
You&apos;re always "that guy" kevin :stuck_out_tongue:, Should be in your email signature. Kevin Ronald. That guy L2.
This planet has truly taken a turn for the weird
Good news everyone. 13th floor smells urinal fresh again.
It&apos;s soccer baseball. Anyone who says differently is a goddamn commie
Each year, thousands of Saskatchewanian teens die from Potash overdose. What do you call someone from Saskatchewan anyway?
Damn squeegie kids
I can&apos;t wait for the "OMG WHAT IS GOING ON!? IS IT ALIENS!?" posts on reddit
BECAUSE YOU SUCK AT EMAIL SHEILA, THAT&apos;S WHY!
"The man had trouble breathing and was found without vital signs, police said." - I would say the man had quite a bit of trouble breathing then
Two scripts enter, one leaves
Yeah, I have enough judgement for everyone
Instructions on time tracking are for dorks
Someone smack @webpackshakur and make sure he doesn&apos;t steal my damn lighter
Quattrin fucked us all
Welp, my day is ruined. Time to go home
I&apos;m going to shake my fist at my screen harder than I&apos;ve ever shaken my fist at a screen before
Are mattresses some new hipster fad?
I only sleep on Trump brand mattresses
I baked you a cockroach casserole Mike
Vegan cheese
Well, trust the Ontario government to go ahead and fuck up something
Captain Crunch, Cinnamon Toast Crunch, Corn Pops or GTFO
Man, I crown you king of one-off useless emojiis

FUUUUUUUUUUUUU...
Anything East of Yonge doesn&apos;t concern me :stuck_out_tongue:
Every single sentence in that article is filled with a new fresh hipster tidbit that makes my blood boil,  Like really? What did your fucking parents tell you when you decided to go to Barista school?
haha, man what a shit sho
Just put some yellow colored liquid in a bottle and tell everyone since you&apos;ve been left no choice you&apos;re bottling your pee. Then ask if they would like some. Sharing is caring.
I love how if you search the emojis for "fish" it brings up a whale like do you not fucking know a whale is not a fish motherfucker?
Screenshot that shit.
Who reads "compost" and thinks "This is where my creamer packets should go?". This is why we have cockroaches, it&apos;s a free for all on 13
are you fired?  whoooo
Yeah, sure, that sounds like fun.
By "Toronto" do they mean actual Toronto? Or are we talking about like Markham or some shit.
Take the rest of the day off
Is funbus happening? I hear noise. The sound of a hundred people dropping their work all at once
If I come down those stairs and theres no beer so help me god.
I think I&apos;m going to go through my emails and search for WFH, Working from home and cat.
The mac and cheese fest left liberty village looking like Baghdad
okay, who is playing latin jams upstairs?. I feel like I&apos;m in Cuba
Any Bryan Adams is the worst one
Fred Durst is a musical genius way ahead of his time
You do not talk shit about DMX
HOW MANY GODDAMN BRYAN ADAMS SONGS CAN WE LISTEN TO IN A ROW!
Yeah, Kristen...we need to go nuclear.  Enya Orinoco flow please. On repeat
seriously, I have never met anyone that liked Bryan Adams
That&apos;s some Jaden Smith level shower thoughts there Mike
That man brought a raccoon to a fist fight. Bold strategy
Seriously, you know who else microwaved popcorn in the office? Hitler. Fact. Look it up. They called him Popcorn-Mikrowellenmonster
It was possessed by the ghost of Steve Jobs.
Yup. If you can spend over a mil on a car you&apos;re obviously doing something right in life.
I told Tolu I would burn this place to the ground if you mess with my crap
What&apos;s the going rate on a donut right now? If I were to walk into Tim Hortons and say "gimme a donut"
Smoothie bowls are hostage taking worth
Lawyer dog is a new sitcom coming to ABC this winter
WFT (working from toilet)
I purposefully fiddle with my phone during uber and cab rides so the driver doesn&apos;t get any ideas. "I&apos;m sorry yo, I&apos;m deep in this candy crush session"
Shooting a truck&apos;s tires is a good way of getting it to move I always find.
Please Please Please Let Me Get What I Want is possibly the most whiny song in existence
You&apos;re an acceptable person
Yeah, I mean I guess I can wear my "Drej Sucks" tshirt over my "F-Drej" one
4Chan is the Mos Eisley of the internet
@zoltan do you get all you can eat decadent chocolate chip cookies?
You know....a average joe smoking a radioactive Chernobyl joint and turning into a stoner superhero is a great plot for a comic book

Hold me Dustin! HOLD ME CLOSE YOUNG DUSTIN SAAAAMPSON
Fyre festival seems like one of those events you&apos;ll always know where you are when it happened.
So who&apos;s starting the "When will Ilana return pool?"
New surface Laptop: "Steve Jobs is dead. All hail your new God"
New Surface Laptop: "Imma just gonna install the latest version of windows on you while you&apos;re doing something important...any objections? Too bad! RESTART!"
Deep Blue Sea is cheesy awesomeness
mmmnn...pita
Deep Blue Sea is better than at least 2 jaws movies.
I think I&apos;m going to learn to do renovations and hire myself out in PEI renovating kitchens.
I&apos;m experiencing what it&apos;s like to try and program on the death star while the rebels are raiding it. It&apos;s very distracting.
I do all the freshest designs in MS Paint. It&apos;s hipster ironic
Pokemon is serious business.
I wish our deadlines were as flexible as Bombardiers.
Hey look, my mouth just filled up with my own vomit
Speaking of blood, blood pudding is weirdly delicious. "Oh I feel like shit, let me put this sausage made out of blood in my mouth". Strangely works.
I tried Pho with tripe once. The texture made it so it could not get anywhere close to my digestive system
I&apos;m thinking from limited experience its disgusting pretty much everywhere
man, if I ever go to Turkey I&apos;m going on hunger strike
I shot a flare gun at our neighbors roof once. Some tense moments.
Are they bagel flavored oranges?
Man....for someone who currently doesn&apos;t own, I&apos;m way too picky about listings. Like: WHY IS THAT OVEN IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE!? WTF IS THAT CARPET?! WHY DOES THAT WALLPAPER LOOK LIKE A VICTORIAN NIGHTMARE!? WHY AM I USING ALL CAPS!
The bible is lit.
Zoltan is a commie plant: confirmed
James Franco seems like a guy who&apos;s never not high
Goddammit grandma just give me your damn pc. You&apos;re not qualified to use it. Dammit grandma, you can&apos;t just hit the "command" button and yell shit at your computer
Closest gas station nachos is the 7/11 on Queen & Strachan. Meet you there.
The answer however, is apparently 10 people. 10 people thought that nothing could possibly go wrong from buying nachos at that place. I thought it was my place. Called the concierge and they told me it was that. Cherry street to liberty village is a long way for smell to travel.  It STUNK. Like what the fuck were you thinking?
Y&apos;all just don&apos;t get the genius philosopher that is Jaden Smith
less pretentious writing, more emojiis
I bet the Nazis charged for guac on a burrito too
How does one misspell "liar"?
GROW UP MICHAEL CORNELIUS QUATTRIN
Durham region is our Florida
Wait...can we go back and discuss how @kozbe is familiar with characters in the 50 shades series?
Me @ Subway: "Just a little bit of sub sauce please."   Subway: "Say no more!" (Proceeds to make a sandwich of 90% sub sauce). I guess Subway&apos;s label as sandwich artist as discussed earlier may be technically correct since they use creative liberties as to what is described as "a little".
My macbook now has sub sauce in the trackpad and keyboard
The only way I go to this bbq is if zoltan spits on his burger. Zoltan&apos;s Famous Spit-Burgers. New joint opening on Queen Street West
Next I&apos;m gonna punch the next girlscout that tries to sell me cookies. FUCK YOU BETSY I&apos;M ON A DIET
And I didn&apos;t cancel the holiday, just course corrected it.
Man, I should create a Lada racing game. The goal is to actually make it across the finish line.
"I&apos;m a dyslexic fuckboi" New band name idea...
Ugh, annoying blaring music is why I hate going to malls. That and USE THE FUCKING ESCALATOR PROPERLY YOU SAVAGES. And Lush. Lush is like someone vomited perfume in your nose.
I like how conversations here are always off the rails and then Rene drops something semi-work related.  It&apos;s like "OFF TOPIC RENE!"
Stop being so judgmental Andrej, Wesbos are people too.
You lost me at "Alanis Morissette Cover"
DID SOMEONE SAY BUTTCRACKS!?
Do you sue yourself for stupidity
"I survived my own damn stupidity"
My watermelons are not only domesticated, they&apos;re housebroken too
Cute animals are the most delicious
the amazing race thing: 1) get meat. 2) roll into ball. 3) eat... actually, no it's 3) cook. 4) eat. yeah, otherwise it&apos;s meatball tartare.
I don&apos;t know what my email is anymore. I think I&apos;m going to just tell people to write me at 134 Peter St.
@webpackshakur going to sudbury in a week and a half...I must find this pork bingo
Pizza email...aaaand Zoltan&apos;s gone
Someone convince Ilana to come back? Tell her I&apos;ll throw in a six pack of beer. The good stuff too...not any Coors or Canadian
emoticon...emoji...what are you kids calling them these days?
chaka is my favourite khan
@zoltan do you accept e-transfers? I do not carry cash as we are heading towards a cashless society. And who&apos;s got time for that ATM crap
And Wine Racks generally are the worst. Like a showcase of the worst Ontario has to offer. I usually find if they&apos;re labelled "red" instead of something like "malbec" or "cabernet sauvignon" then it&apos;s usually sugary crap.
When I&apos;m finished up here. Could be 12, could be like 2 or 3. Depends on how easily my brain can wrap itself around math equations.  "Nah, math is not needed in real life...that&apos;s why we have calculators" - Me in High School

Sorry, Dustin is away. Probably at a hair convention
This conversation has a potential to be TMI
You might want to check out job opportunities in Slovenia
It smells super gnarly up there, so suggest hosting that meeting on 11 or 12. I can taste the smell. By the way, if you&apos;re wondering of what it tastes like, I&apos;m going to go with "A homeless dude peeing in my mouth"
stupid sexy jquery
listen, if you go to a barber and say "gimme the hitler". You may have a racism problem
can we hold hands?
I officially hate our society
pff, Miller...just buy a nice bottle of Chardonnay and toss that shit.  You do not love it, do not lie, Nobody loves it. Not even the brewmaster. He tries it, then says to himself "welp, tastes like piss but the college kids will get trashed off of it"
I&apos;m living in a goddamn warzone
Lab grown meat ftw
Gross is that vegan cheese from Zoltan&apos;s BBQ. It tasted how you would imagine sweaty feet to taste
Stupid lactose tolerant people
@zoltan you guys need to monitor me as I have zero self control. Please also do not let me make drunk purchases of hipster scarves
Rene is responsible for more seizures per capita than Pokemon
I should change my slack name to Mike Quattrin
I love how people toss around the term "politically correct" as an excuse to be an a-hole
On a scale of prostate exam to disneyland on acid, how much fun are you having?
